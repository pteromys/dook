changelog ðŸ§š
============

## Unreleased

- Dynamically load parsers with tree-sitter-loader.
  - Parsers are downloaded from configured urls to ~/.cache/dook/sources.
  - Compiled parsers go in ~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib.
  - Because [it alarms users if we don't ask](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12589),
    ask for confirmation before each download until the user writes YES or NO
    to ~/.config/dook/downloads_policy.txt .
  - Some parsers can be built in at compile time, using the following features:
    - `static_python`
- Support injections (embedded fragments in another language):
  - rust inside rust macros
  - fenced code blocks inside markdown
  - js and css inside html
- New default languages:
  - markdown (look up sections by header)
  - html (look up heading text and id and name attributes)
  - css (look up any ruleset involving a class or id selector)
  - glsl
  - bash
  - lua
  - cython (.pyx)
- Config file format version 3 (never released v2):
  - Add integer "_version" field.
  - Switch to yaml since we use a lot of multi-line strings.
  - Add per-language "parser" field for specifying parser sources.
  - Change queries to single strings.
  - All fields are now optional so your config only needs to be overrides of the default.
  - Parent node types and exclusions are now a query with an optional `@exclude` capture.
  - Language names are case-sensitive and are whatever hyperpolyglot uses.
- New CLI options:
  - `--wrap` and `-S` (forwarded to `bat`)
  - `--stdin` to search on stdin, gated by `stdin` feature
  - `--only-names` to print matching names but not defs (used for completions)
  - `--download=yes|no|ask` to control whether to download parsers (`--offline` = `--download=no`)
  - `--verbose` to litter console output with unstructured progress messages
  - `--ignore-case` (or `-i`) to search case-insensitively. Use twice to search
    kebab/camel/snake/[whatever supported](https://crates.io/crates/heck) cases
    in one go.
- Fixes:
  - Search patterns with `|` no longer fail to restrict to whole-name match.
  - Fixed failing to match some recursion patterns seemingly at random.
  - `--dump` now respects `--paging`.
  - Searching for a function argument now includes the function's doc comments.
    More generally, previous-sibling walk now starts from the outermost ancestor
    starting on the same line.
- Added recognitions:
  - names bound by destructuring in js, ts, tsx, python
  - named function expressions in ts/tsx
  - parent object names in js/ts/tsx
  - struct/enum members and parent structs/enums/traits in rust
  - impls for generic types in rust
  - type aliases and global/nonlocal declarations in python
- Cache tree-sitter query compilation for 4x speedup.
- Add bash and zsh completions.
- Order search by likely imports to try to get results sooner (python).
- Fallback to `grep -r` and DIY i/o if `ripgrep` and `bat` aren't installed.

## 0.2.0 (2024-12-14)

- Don't recurse by defaultâ€”took too long (and was wrong anyway) on python's dict.get(). Sorry!
- Smarter language detection with [hyperpolyglot](https://github.com/monkslc/hyperpolyglot).
- Fixes:
  - Don't include previous line's end-of-line comment.
  - python patterns: include the most basic setattr calls as assignment.
  - js/ts/tsx: catch rest and default params; and arrow functions as parents.
- Tests for C.

## 0.1.1 (2024-07-27)

- Ferret mascot! ðŸ¦¦
- Include stuff on .prototype in js/ts/tsx patterns.

## 0.1.0 (2024-06-30)

- Rename to `dook`.
- Tests.
- Add recursive mode, on by default.
- Improve typescript patterns:
  - Include field definition and assignment.
  - Include enums.
  - Add definitions of types, interfaces, etc as parent/ancestor patterns.

## Initial push to GitHub (cc238ed, 2024-05-12)

- Translate from python and adopt tree-sitter so I can add more languages, now up to: python, go, c, c++, js, ts, tsx, rust.
- Load search patterns from a config file.
