============

## Unreleased

- Fixes:
  - rust: recognize field initializers

## 0.3.0 (2025-06-02)

### Breaking changes

- Config files are now per-language YAML:
  - YAML because it has native multi-line strings, which we now use for queries.
  - Per-language to not blow up startup time as we add more languages.
  - Add integer "version" field.
  - Add "parser" field for specifying parser sources.
  - Add "extends" field for parsers that are similar enough to share queries.
  - All fields are now optional so your config only needs to be overrides of the default.
  - Parent node types and exclusions are now a query with an optional `@exclude` capture.
  - Language names are whatever hyperpolyglot uses, plus some aliases.

### Headline features

- Add bash and zsh completions.
- Add lots more languages (and make them possible to add without recompiling):
  - markdown (look up sections by header)
  - html (look up heading text and id and name attributes)
  - css (look up any ruleset involving a class or id selector)
  - glsl
  - bash
  - lua
  - cython (.pyx)
  - ipynb (as markdown with embedded python fragments)
  - tex/latex (requires [tree-sitter cli](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers/1-getting-started.html#installation))
  - yaml
- Support injections (embedded fragments in another language), including:
  - rust inside rust macros
  - fenced code blocks inside markdown
  - yaml front-matter inside markdown
  - js and css inside html

### Other new features

- New CLI options:
  - `--wrap` and `-S` (forwarded to `bat`)
  - `--stdin` to search on stdin, gated by `stdin` feature
  - `--only-names` to print matching names but not defs (used for completions)
  - `--download=yes|no|ask` to control whether to download parsers (`--offline` = `--download=no`)
  - `--verbose` to litter console output with unstructured progress messages
  - `--version` to print version and exit
  - `--ignore-case` (or `-i`) to search case-insensitively. Use twice to search
    kebab/camel/snake/[whatever supported](https://crates.io/crates/heck) cases
    in one go.
- Internally, we now dynamically load parsers using [tree-sitter-loader](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-loader).
  - Parsers are downloaded from configured urls to `~/.cache/dook/sources`.
  - Compiled parsers go in `~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib`.
  - Because [it alarms users if we don't ask](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12589),
    ask for confirmation before each download until the user writes YES or NO
    to `~/.config/dook/downloads_policy.txt` .
  - Some parsers can be built in at compile time, using the following cargo features:
    - `static_python`
- New features of questionable wisdom:
  - Order search by likely imports to try to get results sooner (python).
  - Fallback to `grep -r` and DIY i/o if `ripgrep` and `bat` aren't installed.

### Fixes

- Search patterns with `|` no longer fail to restrict to whole-name match.
- Fixed failing to match some recursion patterns seemingly at random.
- `--dump` now respects `--paging`.
- Searching for a function argument now includes the function's doc comments.
  More generally, previous-sibling walk now starts from the outermost ancestor
  starting on the same line.
- Cache tree-sitter query compilation for 4x speedup.
- Build with `-z pack-relative-relocs` on supported versions of Linux for a
  1/3 reduction in binary size.
- Added recognitions:
  - names bound by destructuring in js, ts, tsx, python
  - named function expressions in ts/tsx
  - parent object names in js/ts/tsx
  - struct/enum members and parent structs/enums/traits in rust
  - impls for generic types in rust
  - type aliases and global/nonlocal declarations in python

## 0.2.0 (2024-12-14)

- Don't recurse by defaultâ€”took too long (and was wrong anyway) on python's dict.get(). Sorry!
- Smarter language detection with [hyperpolyglot](https://github.com/monkslc/hyperpolyglot).
- Fixes:
  - Don't include previous line's end-of-line comment.
  - python patterns: include the most basic setattr calls as assignment.
  - js/ts/tsx: catch rest and default params; and arrow functions as parents.
- Tests for C.

## 0.1.1 (2024-07-27)

- Ferret mascot! ðŸ¦¦
- Include stuff on .prototype in js/ts/tsx patterns.

## 0.1.0 (2024-06-30)

- Rename to `dook`.
- Tests.
- Add recursive mode, on by default.
- Improve typescript patterns:
  - Include field definition and assignment.
  - Include enums.
  - Add definitions of types, interfaces, etc as parent/ancestor patterns.

## Initial push to GitHub (cc238ed, 2024-05-12)

- Translate from python and adopt tree-sitter so I can add more languages, now up to: python, go, c, c++, js, ts, tsx, rust.
- Load search patterns from a config file.
