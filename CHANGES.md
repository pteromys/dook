changelog ðŸ§š
============

## Unreleased

- Dynamically load parsers with tree-sitter-loader.
  - Sources go in ~/.cache/dook/sources.
  - Compiled parsers go in ~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib.
- Config file format version 2:
  - Add integer "_version" field.
  - Switch to yaml since we use a lot of multi-line strings.
  - Add per-language "parser" field for specifying parser sources.
- Support more `bat` options (`--wrap` and `-S`).
- Fixes:
  - Search patterns with `|` no longer fail to restrict to whole-name match.
  - js/ts/tsx: catch names bound by destructuring.
- Add `--stdin` to search on stdin, gated by `stdin` feature.
- Cache tree-sitter query compilation for 4x speedup.

## 0.2.0 (2024-12-14)

- Don't recurse by defaultâ€”took too long (and was wrong anyway) on python's dict.get(). Sorry!

- Fixes:
  - Don't include previous line's end-of-line comment.
  - python patterns: include the most basic setattr calls as assignment.
  - js/ts/tsx: catch rest and default params; and arrow functions as parents.
- Tests for C.

## Initial push to GitHub (cc238ed, 2024-05-12)

- Translate from python and adopt tree-sitter so I can add more languages, now up to: python, go, c, c++, js, ts, tsx, rust.
- Load search patterns from a config file.
